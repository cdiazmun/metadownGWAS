# metadownGWAS
Reproducible pipeline to perform a GWAS meta-analysis and downstream functional annotation and processing. This repository contains all the information to execute the post-GWAS analysis in a transparent and reproducible manner.

The `README.md` file of each section will serve as a guide/tutorial. Please be aware that most of the scripts will need to be adapted to your files, path, and directory organization. The pipeline consists of the following steps:

1. PostGWAS QC
2. Meta-analysis, rsID assignment, and Manhattan plots
3. Fine-mapping
4. Genetic correlation & heritability estimation (LDSC)
5. Functional annotation
6. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA)
7. Phenome-wide association study (PheWAS)
8. Mendelian randomization (MR)
9. Colocalization analysis
10. Polygenic risk scores (PRS)
11. Drug analysis - *unpublished, coming soon*
