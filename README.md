# metadownGWAS
Reproducible pipeline to perform a GWAS meta-analysis and downstream analysis. This repository contains all the information to execute the post-GWAS analysis in a transparent and reproducible manner.

The `README.md` file of each section will serve as a guide/tutorial. Please be aware that most of the scripts will need to be adapted to your files, path, and directory organization. The pipeline consists of the following steps:

1. PostGWAS QC
2. Meta-analysis
3. rsID assignment
4. Genetic correlation & heritability estimation (LDSC)
5. Functional annotation
6. Fine-mapping
7. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) - *Work in progress*
8. Mendelian Randomization - *Work in progress*
9. Colocalization analysis - *TBD*
10. Phenome-wide association study (PheWAS)
11. Drug analysis
12. Polygenic Risk Scores (PRS) - *TBD*
